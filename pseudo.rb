# 1. A method that returns the sum of two integers
# Creath a method that takes in two paramters
# Within that method, those two parameters need to be added
# The arguments for the parameters will have to be user-inputted
# then you have to call the method

# 2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all thoses
# strings concatenated together
# Create a method definition
# In this definition,
# use map to iterate and change the new array
# iterate through with a vairable
# the variable must concatenate each value

# A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
# You could have a method definition that iterates through the array and 
# simultaneously pulls the index numbers of that array.
# After retrieving the indexes, you could have this definition only return the values with the
# odd indexes.
